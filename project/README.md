## Project Description
My project is about restaurants and cafes in Amsterdam. I belive that they can be a reflection of the city and really important for urban culture. I also would love to see that places work not only for tourists but also for the local population, so that people could enjoy a nice meal without leaving their neighbirhood.

## Questions & Hypotheses
I live not far from the city centre but my area lacks local restaurants and cafes. I wanted to check whether they are evenly distributed across other city districts, what the hot spots are, how the number of places correlates with the number of local population. I knew that they are concentrated mainly in the touristic centre, but was curious to come across something unusual.

## Dataset
1. HoReCa operating permits https://data.amsterdam.nl/datasets/GsY50tEkoJKCGw/verleende-exploitatievergunningen-horeca-met-terrasgrenzen-en-ontheffingen/


2. Hotels https://data.overheid.nl/dataset/smyieailr6urlg


3. Population in Amsterdam by postcode https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/83503NED/table?ts=1597240628187


4. Tripadvisor restaurants rating https://www.kaggle.com/damienbeneschi/krakow-ta-restaurans-data-raw


Very important website where I checked the postcode areas: https://postcodebijadres.nl/amsterdam

## Database
I cut the data more and more and checked several hypothesis step by step, so I don't have a single table as an output.

## Workflow
1. Research about the topic
2. Datasets search
3. Data Wrangling
4. Analysis
5. Writing down the results
6. Mentor meeting
7. Presentation preparation
The process was not linear, I repeated steps 2-5 several times as I added more data.

## Organization
I used Trello board.

Repository is divided into datasets, presentation (with maps and text file with results) and project (code and README file)
